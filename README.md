# Control-System-Analysis
This repository contains coursework for a control systems module, focusing on modeling, implementing, and analyzing a control system using MATLAB Simulink.
<br/>
<br/>
<H3>Overview</H3>
This coursework aims to introduce students to control systems and their analysis through a series of tasks involving modeling, implementation of controllers, and system analysis. The main objectives include:
<br/>
<H4>1. Modeling the Initial System (Plant):</H4>
-Create a dynamic model of a simple vehicular system using MATLAB Simscape.
<br/>
-Model a vehicle as a solid mass in an environment with gravity but without ground.
<br/>
-Represent the vehicle with rigid bodies, bricks solids, joints, wheels, and axels.
<br/>
-Model vehicular movement as a simple force along a prismatic joint, capturing speed as the output.
<br/>
<H4>2. Adding the Controller:</H4>
-Implement and tune a PID Controller to regulate the vehicle's speed.
<br/>
-Use the PID Autotuning tool in Simulink for initial tuning, followed by manual fine-tuning.
<br/>
-Ensure the vehicle accelerates to the desired speed and maintains it throughout the simulation.
<br/>
<H4>3. System Analysis:</H4>
-Perform an analysis of the overall system, including both the controller and plant.
<br/>
-Utilize MATLAB Simulink tools to generate and interpret step response and Bode diagrams.
<br/>
-Assess the stability of the system and its suitability with respect to specified requirements.
